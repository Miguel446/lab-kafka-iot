  <p align="center">
    A project to simulate an IOT Application using Kafka and Java + Spring.
  </p>
  <p align="center">
    The idea is to learn Kafka fundamentals and some new Java features, such as Virtual Threads, in a single project that gets improved over time instead of creating multiple small projects.

    * For testing purposes only, not recommended for production enviroment.
